# homepage

I made some small changes, like being able to directly type a website url into the search bar, a greeting, the date and time. You can also hover some link so it shows website subdomains and I changed some search prefixes.

Theres a search bar at the bottom that uses prefixes such as !g (google) or !y (youtube) to search different websites (code from twily: http://twily.info/firefox/). These can be edited in the js file.

Available search websites and their prefixes:

- Default: DuckDuckGo
- !g: Google
- !i: Google Images
- !y: Youtube
- !w: Wikipedia
- !t: Google Translate
- !r: Reddit search
- !s: Subreddit
- !u: Urban Dictionary
- !b: Bing Images (since Google removed View Image feature)
